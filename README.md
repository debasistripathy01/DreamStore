# Problem Statement

Our Problem statement is to build a pixel-perfect Dermstore website clone. Previously I cloned two websites and some web pages but in this problem, we were supposed to make pages dynamic and responsive too.

## Idea

Since We are pursuing a Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School I was given a project to clone **Dermstore ** which is a skincare and beauty e-commerce site in the United States. Since December 2020, it is a subsidiary of The Hut Group which is a British e-commerce company.  I was given a team of five members including me and the task was to clone the pixel-perfect clone of the website. Let's look at how we designed it ðŸ‘‡. We also Optimized this Whole project Using Plugins too.

## Dermstore Landing Page ðŸ‘‡ ðŸ’»
On the Home Page, there are many options like a search bar where users can search products by product name or Brand, then there is also an account option where users can log in or signup and beside it, a cart option is also there and by clicking on the cart option users can see the products which they have added to the cart.
users can also see new arrivals products and scroll through them just by clicking the buttons which are present on the left and right sides.

## About Project:
